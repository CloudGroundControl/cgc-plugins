# cgc-plugins

Sample plugins and tools built by the CGC team.

View [Sample Plugins](sample) here. Each plugin has its own README.md file with instructions on how to build and run the plugin with our test harness.

To simulate the CGC Plug-In Framework, you can use the [Test Harness](test-harness/README.md) tool.
